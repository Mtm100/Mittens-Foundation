        <p> We are a Wellington community-based organisation focused on helping and  connecting as may pets as we can to loving homes. Here at the Mittens team, weâ€™re trying to foster a community of pet loving owners throughout the region of Wellington and beyond. Through linking as many pets to great homes as we can, we hope to better the lives of as many people and pets as possible!</p>
